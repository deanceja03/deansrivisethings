	<h3><center>Watching Anime!</center></h3>
	<caption><center>I have been watching anime for years, my favorite anime currently is "Chainsaw Man". I have 2 tattoos of my first animes.

	<h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
	<caption><center>I really enjoy playing a game called "League of Legends". I have met some of my bestest friends on it and I have great memories with it. I also am a huge fan of a esports player called "Faker".I also love playing Sims, spending around 1,000+ hours in that game haha. My favorite story games would be the Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us. <center></caption>

	<h3> Writing </h3>
	<caption>Writing my double-edged sword. I love doing it but I also have artist tendencies of self critising myself a little bit too much. I do it a lot almost everyday! I sometimes can write 10k words about one subject but othertimes I can only type 500 words for others. It all depends on how passionate I am on the story/topic. I love reading and improving my writing.</caption>
