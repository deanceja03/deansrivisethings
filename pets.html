				<h1>About Moss</h1>
				<p> Moss is 1.7 years old, he is a mixed shorthair. He was my first pet (funny enough I am allergic to cats). We got him when he was 3 months old. I have fallen in love with him and would protect him from all the dangers of the world. My favorite memory is when I come home or wake up I always stretch his arms. He always expects it. Sometimes he gets in trouble by eating my mother's plants or jumping on Nam-Nam's tank when I'm not looking. </p>

				<h1>About Snowball</h1>
				<p> I got Snowball around January, my first hamster. She was my first animal I got working at Petco! She had catfished me, while working there she was very calm and let me pet her. The moment I took her home, she had turned a full 180 on me. She is not a big fan of me. Anything I do, she still bites me but not other people. T_T I always wonder what I did wrong to make her hate me but I would do anything for her.</p>

				<h1>About Nam-Nam</h1>
				<p>Nam-Nam is my second lizard! He is my very precious boy, he deals with all my goofy things I put him through. I got him on April 1st, funny enough. He was my second animal at Petco and my last. Nam-Nam is the chillest lizard I could have gotten. I love him very much! Nam-Nam is a bit stingy and only sometimes eats his salad. He loves to explore his tank and my bedroom, jumping from pillow to the bed sometimes. Fun Fact: He is named after Nanami from an anime called "Jujustu Kaisen".</p>
