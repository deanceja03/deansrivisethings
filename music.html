	<p><center> Ahhh! This song makes me feel so many amazing things. One of my best friends had showed me this song. It made me start watching an anime called "One Piece". This song never gets old and always has me blasting it in the car. The lyrics and everything in it makes my heart fire up!</center></p>

	<p><center>The guitar. The singing. The lyrics. Each of it is chef kiss. I love everything about this song. I love songs that convey this type of desperation.</center></p>

	<p><center>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH this song, so CATCHY! It is my life goal to learn this entire song. The lyrics...oh my god. Maybe it's because I'm a hopeless romantic but I obessess over this song.</p>

	<p><center>I have loved this artist for years now, counting close to 5. Their singing calms me down in any scenario. This song gave me a warm hug on my coldest days and was there for me on any of the good ones. The MV is so well done and never fails to make me inspired from their work.</center></p>

	<p><center>The one song I wish could last forever. Although I would say deftones is one of my favorite bands, this song was one of the first songs I've listened to. It means a lot to me and it can be used for most situations, it's serious enough to use it for rainy days. Although the song is called "Sextape" I find the song so endearing and actually romantic.</center></p>
